;; StacksLend: Decentralized Credit Protocol for Bitcoin DeFi
;;
;; A merit-based lending protocol that bridges traditional credit systems 
;; with Bitcoin DeFi through Stacks Layer 2. Features include:
;;
;; - Dynamic credit scoring based on on-chain behavior
;; - Risk-adjusted collateral requirements (50-100%)
;; - Variable interest rates (5-10% based on credit score)
;; - Transparent loan history and credit reporting
;; - Maximum loan duration of 1 year (52,560 blocks)
;; - Up to 5 active loans per user
;;
;; Security measures:
;; - Required minimum credit score of 70
;; - Collateral locked in contract
;; - Automatic credit score adjustments
;; - Owner-only default management
